# Developement Notice
Due to me losing my raspberry pi pico in the depths of my junk drawer, Developement of this project has become slower. I will still continue to support this project and developement will restart once i get a new pico. In the meantime, i have continued to implement some features except they have not been tested and could be completeley broken. I will start debugging features once i get a pico.
